# Simplified version of the 35/pb H->WW analysis for mH = 160 GeV
imax 4  number of channels

kmax *  number of nuisance parameters (sources of systematical uncertainties)

# we have just one channel, in which we observe 0 events

observation 
------------
# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in that bin
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal
# then we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
# on each process and bin
